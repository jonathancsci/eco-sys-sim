# EcoSysSim
EcoSysSim is a CLI application for the real-time observation of population dynamics in a simulated environment. The simulated environment is an 8 way grid world with obstacles. Animal behaviors (for bears, wolves, foxes, deer and rabbits) are inspired by real-world behaviors. Users are able to set the initial conditions for the simulated environment and observe the population dynamics through a real time plot.

## Run the application
1. Install requirements.txt with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Run `python app.py` and follow the on-screen prompts.

> [!WARNING]
> 
> If the population of any species surpasses 300 individuals during the simulation, you should probably stop the simulation to prevent your computer from freezing.
